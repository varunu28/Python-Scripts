#Check Profanity

Have you ever faced a situation where you were embarresed because you type in a silly/curse
word while typing a letter or an email. 
Here is a solution for that. Just put your draft in a text file. Give the path to your text file
in this script in quotes=open("PATH HERE") and run the script. 

You will instantly get to know if the letter or email you had typed contains and curse words or not.
And this will save you from embarresment at work or home.
