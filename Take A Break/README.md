#Take A Break

This script is easy to run. Just download it to your system.

I have coded it initially to keep 3 study intervals of 30 minutes each.


If you want to do some modifications then follow the following steps:
- To increase or decrease the value of your study interval just change the 
  value inside the time.sleep("Your Time Here") function.
- To change the number of intervals for which you want to study just change
  the value of interval variable in the code.
- I have kept a 3 minute video of calming music. If you want to change it then
  change the url in webbrowser.open("LINK HERE") function

Hope this script would help you in planning your study sessions in a better way
and hope you get the best out of them
